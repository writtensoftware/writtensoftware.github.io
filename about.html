title: About Written Software
---

Hey there! In case you've stumbled on this site and are wondering what it is,
it's the very small home of a very small software shop (...just me).
My name's <a href="http://nicholas.zaillian.com" rel="nofollow">Nicholas</a>. I've done contract software development and consulting for a couple of New York's fastest growing startups. I still find time to hack on many interesting things in my spare time and decided they deserve a new home on the internet. If you would like to discuss licensing or integration assistance for any apps you find on this page, or anything else at all, send an email to <a href="mailto:contact@writtensoftware.com">contact@writtensoftware.com</a>! Thanks for dropping by!
